Each time a wild magic-user casts or activates a spell with a level variable, they randomly determine the resulting spell level. The player must roll 1d3 at the moment the spell is cast. A result of 1 the spell level is lower, 2 unaffected, and 3 higher. Subtract 1d6 from the spell level (to a minimum of 1) if the result was lower. Add 1d6 to the spell level if higher. A spell level can be higher than 14.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary on Spell Level Variability</strong><br>\nI definitely prefer simplicity for classes as much as possible, and simplicity overall is a big reason why our gaming group plays Old-School Essentials. The above spell level variability is mechanically simple, but it does mean low-level wild magic-users have little to risk if a cast spell must be lowered in level since the minimum will always be 1. This is fine. Go nuts! Gamble with that magic missile or make light last a ridiculous amount of time if the dice favor you. Chances are high they have a wild surge (below) if they are low-level!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wild Surges</strong><br>\nWild magic-user spells sometimes unfold in spectacular wild surges that could prove catastrophic to the wild magic-user and their companions. Each time a wild magic-user casts or activates a spell, roll 1d6 on the table below to see if a random magical effect is unleashed. If a wild surge is unleashed, the referee determines the result from an exhaustive table of possible side-effects (<a href=\"https://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv2.pdf\">Net Libram of Random Magical Effects</a> by Orrex).</p>\n<p>At 5th level, a wild magic-user gains the ability to roll twice for every wild surge and choose the result.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Wild Surge</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1-5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1-5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1-5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1-5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1-2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commentary on Wild Surge</strong><br>\nThe first part is pretty straightforward. The chance of a wild surge occurring is higher at lower levels and becomes less common at higher levels. Any cast spell has a chance of wild surging (even if it has no level variable effects!).</p>\n<p>At 5th level we allow wild magic-users to roll twice for every wild surge and choose the result they want. This accomplishes a couple things:</p>\n<p>1 - It conveys the feeling of a wild magic-user gaining more control over the raw and unstructured magic they cast as they become more disciplined in their lack of discipline.</p>\n<p>2 - There may be times where a wild magic-user is interested in subduing or increasing the chances of a wild surge occurring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In trying to roll as little as possible at a table, I prefer to click buttons instead.<br>\n<a href=\"https://haa-gg.github.io/Improbability-Drive/\">Improbability Drive</a> by Glendon Gengel makes it effortless to leverage the chaos of the Net Libram of Random Magical Effects.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Wild Magic-User B/X Class","date":"December 16, 2019","description":"Used in my gaming group's open table campaign."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/wild-magic-user-class/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/things-can-only-get-better/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Things Can Only Get Better"}},"next":null}}}
